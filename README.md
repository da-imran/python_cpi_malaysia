# Predictive Analysis on Cost of Living in Malaysia
#### This is a final year project for my undegraduate degree in Universiti Teknologi Mara Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia. This project investigates the factors influencing the cost of living in Malaysia and develops a Machine Learning model to predict future cost of living indices. It leverages various machine learning algorithms and data visualization techniques to present insights and trends.

## Objectives
#### Identify key factors: Explore data to uncover the most significant elements affecting cost of living in Malaysia. <br> Predict cost of living: Build and train machine learning models to forecast future cost of living indices. <br> Visualize results: Create clear and informative dashboards to effectively communicate findings and trends.
